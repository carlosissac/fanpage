    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p> There are only a few truly great experimental rock bands, groups so massively unique that the aftershocks of their influence rumble and reverberate for decades. At the top of that very short list is Sonic Youth. Snark if you will about their longevity, but give them all their due credit. </p>
    <p> They dragged the sound of New York minimalism into the mainstream. They took techniques from composers like John Cage and applied them to electric guitars — and they didn’t do it at a conservatory or in a recital hall. They did it in hockey arenas. They did it at Glastonbury. They took the banal, brute force of American hardcore and No Wave, and folded it back into itself, creating a radical new performance idiom, one that brimmed with wry intelligence, tactical aggression, and, yes, aural and verbal lyricism. </p>
    <p> There are legions of bands formed in the last 20 years that should be paying them royalties, just on general principle. Sonic Youth belong in the rarified company of giants like Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, The Velvet Underground, This Heat, and Faust, and they’ve been active for as long — and sold as many records — as all those bands combined. Yet they continue to champion the international avant-garde to successive generations of young, open ears. </p>
